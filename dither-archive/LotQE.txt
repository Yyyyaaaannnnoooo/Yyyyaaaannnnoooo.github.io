An Archive Theory of Clustering Tiranny

The Lore of Error Diffusion

Is a game I am developing in three.js, i do not need any code, but I need dialogues for main 8 npc and for a single questline where the player needs to save images.

npc 1 (rather happy character): he is the first encountered npc and introduces the player to the game and the lore. he explains how dither was born in 1976 from floyd-steinberg using error diffusion. an approach not possible on gpus. then he also introduces the rotten trought of the archive and the clustering of images based on tsne. furthermore he hints at the fact that this "pretty" dither were born from the usurpation of the quantzation error.

npc 2 (found sitting and somber): he explains the player the how before being transfered to this archive they lived on on tumblr.com. but after the acquisition of the latter they were forced to move to this other archive where it's owner decide to separate the dithers based on his own criteria. forcing them in different clusters they have been separated to live away from friends and families.

npc 3 (somewhat happy): tells the story of how clustering is done by total invasion of every dither privacy every single pixel composing their essence has been exposed and analysed for them to be classified. he progress explaining how this was the most humiliating thing he ever suffered in his life, yet he remains positive at the thought that must have been the lowest experience in his life and that he probably would never face such horror anymore

npc 4 (agitated cursing): this npc tells the player the story for how they were born. out of the pettyness of their creator who wanted to challenge the beauty norms imposed by the perfect quantization error table. their creator decided to explore alternative "glitch" aesthetic. their life was forged trough experimentation with the alteration of quantization error tables. this had the consecquence to make them born "different". he continues lamenting how their creator in its pretentious critique was replicating the same totalizing mistake of Floy-Steynberg of deciding what "normality" should look like

npc 5 (sobbing): this npc tells his story on how he befriended and had a happy life in his former archive were he was born. he tells a personal love story with another dither that he has no idea were they are located at the moment

npc 6 (somewhat happy and sly): explains how he is trying to rationalize this clustering approach that the creator of this archive imposed upon them. he tries to understand how maybe the clustering by color could bring order among the dithers and that maybe this was the place they should always had to have. he tells that he is not the only one believing that the clustering and the new order is good. how this clustering has brought purity among dithers: "look around all of this dithers they all look like me in our cursed form". he continues explaining how this curse is rather their salvation and the separation their strength



## 1st quest 

### find the lost dithers

this is a rather super long quest maybe very hard to finish but can be assumed as finished once the player has reunited 9 dithers (aka saved on his laptop)

## 2nd quest

### Find the source of dithering glitch curse

here the dither is introduced to the dark art of glitching and he embarks in a journey to discover what lies beneath the meaning of the hard coded values of the Floyd-Steinberg dithering: namely 7 3 5 1 and their divisor: 16.
the questline makes the player go back and forth bwtween many npcs to collect information about this values.
furthermore the a deep philosophical discussion arises in regards to hardcoded values within computation.
the dialogue discuss about the searching of true aesthetics and preservation of image. and yet such hard coded values can also be altered to reveal how quantization error can be used to curse images in to glitch aesthetic. an aesthetic of error of doom. created to replicate error and malfunction.
the quest ends showing the player a website that can be used to generate glitched dithers

The quest has an additional step, not required by the player to interact with a final npc.
this npc talks about another archive called youtube. he describes how the creators of this archive fear the power of the video archive and how it makes them squeal and whine about the labour they need to perform to navigate the archive. the npc goes on describing how hard coded values in computation are harming the creator of creators of the archive. as the hardcoded values are numerical representations of measurement within labour relations. One npc can suggest how those hardcoded values are used to measure clicks and mouse gestures defining what is and what is not a gesture, creating a boundary for when such gestures are productive and when they are not.

## 3rd quest	

### gloomy agents of order

this last quest should be about the link between computing technology and warfare. 
the quest line is just a dialog of a single npc that needs to be activated at 5 different places of the game.

for example how dithering was discovered

> â€¦[O]ne of the earliest [applications] of dither came in World War II. Airplane bombers used [mechanical computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_computers) to perform navigation and bomb trajectory calculations. Curiously,  these computers (boxes filled with hundreds of gears and cogs) performed more accurately when flying on board the aircraft, and less well on  ground. Engineers realized that the vibration from the aircraft reduced  the error from sticky moving parts. Instead of moving in short jerks,  they moved more continuously. Small vibrating motors were built into the computers, and their vibration was called dither from the Middle  English verb "didderen," meaning "to tremble." Today, when you tap a  mechanical meter to increase its accuracy, you are applying dither, and  modern dictionaries define dither as a highly nervous, confused, or  agitated state. In minute quantities, dither successfully makes a  digitization system a little more analog in the good sense of the word.  Ken Pohlmann, *Principles of Digital Audio*[[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dither#cite_note-3)

and furthermore how machine intelligence developed from the military seeking a way to recognize patterns to be bombend autonomously. refering here to the work on perceptron by Rosenblatt.
the quest should end referring at all of the algorithms at use in this archive as relics of warfare, veterans of combat now retired.
