            The algorithm intrudes on the planetary as an act of vigilance against itself.<br><br>

At its most sanguine, this breech is a form of care and regeneration; at its most disparaging protection and preservation. Digital audio sensors, close-circuit video, satellite tracking, drone surveillance, identification tags, and LIDAR mapping encroaches on the wild coating god's green earth in a blanket of machinic vision.<br><br>

Entirety as earth is a great reveal. An embedded cord of contact and contract, a pulse of data. An attempt to find an ever receding frame for simultanément. Earthly natures were always Othered, but we're getting closer to devouring and encasing them whole.<br><br>

The unmanned aerial-craft takes to the skies swerving between radio waves and satellite signals. Surveillance of what is in order to visualize the passage of time since what was. Joining the ranks of machinic control, conservationism wishes to make time frozen. The moment we come on-line is the moment of solidification-an instant good enough to be protected. Reversal is deemed pseudoscience, so we'll settle for cryogenics.<br><br>

An automated wilderness emerges. Once cordoned off, territories turn into mud and are forever muddied. The familiar slippage from safety zone to war zone. Pitted against one another, the nonhuman of the future faces off against the nonhuman of the past. Coders, scientists, explorers, and vigilantes are crammed onto a fulcrum between ancestors and robots.<br><br>

In response, nature expands stealthily on a plane unrecognized and otherworldly. Talents for evasion shine brightly yet escape the flatness of the retina. Imagined summersaults of avoidance are theorized and speculated as a refusal of the machine, but in actuality the skin of the animal maneuvers around the algorithm with grace.<br><br>

In silos of secret circumvention, nature reaches out for defiance in those modes of being that have been deemed cumbersome and sloppy in the evolutionary handbook-or perhaps have been merely out of scope: domination using remote sensing only goes so far.<br><br>

Turning back toward the amateur, efficiency changes due course. And with little to no effort, the victim slowly eviscerate machinic control.<br><br>

Control that was always myopic.<br><br>

The fully automated ecosystem is hovering in speculative purgatory, but it is certainly within reach. There is hope that a wilderness managed by machinic surveillance might keep the dangers of the human at arms-length. But what makes us think that the coupling of nature and machine will trigger harmony? Maybe an equilibrium is possible, but not without first an act of refusal. There is cause to believe that nature will find a way to decline our efforts to encase it. <br><br>

With new technologies it is possible not only to know the geographies of animals but to place the scientific gaze onto particular, individual iterations of the species. The empire penguin finds itself between the worlds of the ice and water with a sensor on its wing and a camera attached to its shoulder.<br>
The ways with which we see the ecosystem is no longer a question of patterning but an intimacy of individualism. As the machinic eye follows, the nonhuman becomes anthropomorphized as a kind of  pet, Yet, crucially, enclosure into the anthropocene will provide holes and slippages. In the quest for preservation, the evolutionary impulse cannot be paralyzed, only affected. <br><br>

So, the algorithm senses (with sensors) to find causes of current effects-and in so doing, affects. Causality may not be so much an “uncovering” or a “demystification” but rather centered around the idea of mystery. “Causality is a secretive affair, yet out in the open–an open secret.” In order to contain and control in the name of conservation, the perpetual collection of data seeks to uncover the secrets of nature. But its program will always fall short. The sensorial limits of the machine mirror the sensorial limits of the human. <br><br>

Though, the sensorial limits of nature exceed our epistemic reach. The dung beetle harnesses the milky way to find direction, the carrier pigeon uses magnetoreception to return to its nest. When the drone casts its pervasive eye on a remote territory, the trees have that uncanny feeling that they're being watched. The wolves in the forest have pinpointed the position of the satellites above them and adjust their migratory patterns to evade them. Underwater, scallops can anticipate when the dredging instruments are approaching to scrape the seafloor with long rakes, their interior composition churning with fear. <br><br>

While looking for causes of shifts in the climate, ecosystem, ocean currents, and animal behaviors we cause a new wave of reproach from the natural world. Avoidance and refusal take form in the aesthetic and sensorial territories just outside the bounds of our perception. The nonhuman adapts to surveillance out in the open, but the means of adaptation are hidden from us. As a result, species find gaps in our programs of observation. Nature veers toward alien traits, accentuating unknowable ontologies to escape the machine's grasp. As the Greek philosopher Heraclitus once said, “nature loves to hide.” A never-ending chase has begun, and it is hidden out in the open.
