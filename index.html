        My first experience with
        <u>dither</u> was during my my first year of master.
        <br> During the first year I needed to print a gradient, but our printer was not good enough. the prints were full of
        <u>artifacts</u> due to the large amount of colors in a gradient.
        <br> I decided therefore to use the photoshop built-in tool for color palette reduction. The tool provided various options
        to choose between different
        <u>dither</u> algorithms. This was the result I had while playing with the tool.

        WOW!
        <br> EYE BLEEDING!
      </div>
      <p>
        But it was olnly one year later that I mastered the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd%E2%80%93Steinberg_dithering" target="_blank">Floyd‚ÄìSteinberg</a> dithering algorithm. This was possible also thank to
        <a href="https://github.com/danielepiccone/dithering_algorithms" target="_blank">Daniele Piccone</a>,
        <a href="http://danieltemkin.com/DitherStudies/About" target="_blank">Daniel Temkin</a> and their amazing work. Last and but not least this text about
        <a href="http://www.efg2.com/Lab/Library/ImageProcessing/DHALF.TXT" target="_blank">"digital halftoning, or dithering"</a> was quite helpful to understand the mechanics of
        <u>dithering</u>.
        <br>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd%E2%80%93Steinberg_dithering" target="_blank">Floyd‚ÄìSteinberg</a> dithering works by using an error diffusion algortihm
      </p>
      <div class="citation">
        meaning it pushes (adds) the residual quantization error of a pixel onto its neighboring pixels.
      </div>
      <p>
        It spreads the error accroding to some hard-coded values as follows
      </p>
      <table style="width: 100%; font-size: 75%">
        <tr>
          <th>[ ]</th>
          <th>[ ]</th>
          <th>[ ]</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>[ ]</th>
          <th>[*]</th>
          <th>[7/16]</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>[3/16]</th>
          <th>[5/16]</th>
          <th>[1/16]</th>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>
        <u style="font-size: 75%;">The pixel with the * indicates the pixel being currently scanned</u>
        <br>
        <br> Those values became my playground for the exploration of the
        <u>dithering</u> algorithm. My first step was to change the common
        <u>divisor (16)</u> of the those hard-coded values.
      </p>
      <input id="div" style="width: 100%" type="range" value="1" min="1" max="30" step="1" onchange="updateValues()">
      <table style="width: 100%; font-size: 75%">
        <tr>
          <th>[ ]</th>
          <th>[ ]</th>
          <th>[ ]</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>[ ]</th>
          <th>[*]</th>
          <th>[7/
            <span class="dividend">16</span>]</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>[3/

            <span class="dividend">16</span>]</th>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <br>
      <p>
        This lead to the creation of a
        <a href="http://prettydither.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Tumblr-Bot</a>, posting dithered gradients with random values as dividend in the error quantization algorithm.

      <img src="img/DitherWEB.png " alt=" ">
      <p>
        The next step was to create a
        <a href="https://twitter.com/tobonay" target="_blank">Twitter-Bot</a>, reacting to the
        <u>#prettyDither</u> hashtag, followed by two colors, i.e. #prettyDither

      <p>
        In order to gain a better control over the algorithm I decided to control also the the
        <u>divisor</u> of the error quantization algortihm

        I implemented this to control the the calculation of the quantization error among all the neighboring pixels, not only the
        4 in use in the Floyd‚ÄìSteinberg algorithm. this lead to the development of this
        <a href="http://yyyyyyyy.xyz/dither/" target="_blank">website</a>, that allows user to control each part of the algorithm.

        The interesting thing about the
        <u>dithering</u> algorithm, is its
        <u>camouflaging</u> attitude. What do I mean? Good
        <u>dithering</u> algorithms, when properly developed, should remain unnoticed by the viewers eyes. Curiously enough
        when the same algorithm is applied to gradients its
        <u>camouflaging</u> qualities get weaker revealing the algorithm structure in the form of colorful patterns. Thee additional
        control on the quantization error algortihm allows for more in depth analysis of the
        <u>dithering</u> process.

        <a href="http://www.hek.ch/ ">@H3K</a>. Thanks to
        <a href="http://www.wekinator.org/ ">Wekinator</a>, a machine learning software, it was possible to train a model with celebrities faces, and their astrological
        sign. People can sit in front of the camera and let their face be scanned. The trained model matches their face traits
        with the ones in the datatbase. At the end the matching horoscope is printed. The project was done to bring awareness
        about the use of machine learning in the facial recognition field.

        <img src="img/selberschuld_02.jpg" alt=" ">
        <br> The expression is repeatedly used to design a line diagram, in which the darker letter draw the statistics. Those
        three examples extremely represent how far we can go with our non-solidarity practice. Incapable to help, we rather
        decide that the guilt of their disgrace is only upon them, relieving us from being empathic. (that in my understanding
        means: I really don‚Äôt care about your problems let me live my life without being involved in yours)
