            My first experience with
            <u>dither</u> was during my my first year of my Masters. During the first year I needed to print a gradient,
            but
            our
            printer was not good enough. The prints were full of
            <u>artifacts</u> due to the large amount of colors in a gradient. I decided therefore to use the Photoshop
            built-in
            tool for colour palette reduction. The tool provided various options to choose between different
            <u>dither</u> algorithms. This was the result I had while playing with the tool.

            WOW!
            <br> EYE BLEEDING!
        </div>
        <p>
            But it was olnly one year later that I mastered the
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd%E2%80%93Steinberg_dithering"
                target="_blank">Floyd–Steinberg</a>
            dithering algorithm. This was possible also thanks to
            <a href="https://github.com/danielepiccone/dithering_algorithms" target="_blank">Daniele Piccone</a>,
            <a href="http://danieltemkin.com/DitherStudies/About" target="_blank">Daniel Temkin</a> and their amazing
            work.
            Last and but not least this text about
            <a href="http://www.efg2.com/Lab/Library/ImageProcessing/DHALF.TXT" target="_blank">"digital halftoning, or
                dithering"</a> was quite helpful to understand the mechanics of
            <u>dithering</u>.
            <br>
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd%E2%80%93Steinberg_dithering"
                target="_blank">Floyd–Steinberg</a>
            dithering works by using an error diffusion algortihm
        </p>
        <div class="citation">
            meaning it pushes (adds) the residual quantization error of a pixel onto its neighboring pixels.
        </div>
        <p>
            It spreads the error according to some hard-coded values as follows:
        </p>
        <table style="width: 100%; font-size: 75%">
            <tr>
                <th>[ ]</th>
                <th>[ ]</th>
                <th>[ ]</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th>[ ]</th>
                <th>[*]</th>
                <th>[7/16]</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th>[3/16]</th>
                <th>[5/16]</th>
                <th>[1/16]</th>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p>
            <u style="font-size: 75%;">The pixel with the * indicates the pixel being currently scanned by the
                algorithm.</u>
            <br>
            <br> Those values became my playground for the exploration of the
            <u>dithering</u> algorithm. My first step was to change the common
            <u>divisor (16)</u> of the those hard-coded values.
        </p>
        <p>
            This lead to the creation of a
            <a href="http://prettydither.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Tumblr-Bot</a>, posting dithered gradients with
            random
            values as dividend in the error quantization algorithm.
        </p>

        <p>
            The next step was to create a
            <a href="https://twitter.com/tobonay" target="_blank">Twitter-Bot</a>, reacting to the
            <u>#prettyDither</u> hashtag, followed by two colors, i.e. #prettyDither
            <span style="background: #fff; color: #f00">red</span>
            <span style="background: #fff; color: #0f0">green</span>
        </p>
        <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/219866411" frameborder="0"></iframe>
        <p>
            In order to gain a better control over the algorithm I decided to control also the the
            <u>divisor</u> of the error quantization algortihm
        </p>
        <table style="width: 100%; font-size: 75%">

            </tr>

        <p>
            I implemented this to control the the calculation of the quantization error among all the neighboring
            pixels,
            not only the
            4 in use in the Floyd–Steinberg algorithm. this lead to the development of this
            <a href="http://yyyyyyyy.xyz/dither/" target="_blank">website</a>, that allows user to control each part of
            the
            algorithm.

            The interesting thing about the
            <u>dithering</u> algorithm, is its
            <u>camouflaging</u> attitude. What do I mean? Good
            <u>dithering</u> algorithms, when properly developed, should remain unnoticed by the viewers eyes. Curiously
            enough
            when the same algorithm is applied to gradients its
            <u>camouflaging</u> qualities get weaker revealing the algorithm structure in the form of colorful patterns.
            The
            additional
            control on the quantization error algortihm allows for more in depth analysis of the
            <u>dithering</u> process.
